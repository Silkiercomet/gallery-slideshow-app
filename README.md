## My process

Due to this page's nature of having numerous pages, I decided that the best approach was to use Next.js to dynamically create the routes and their pages on the server because all the pages are static pages their content is informative and doesn't change 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwindcss
- Next.js

### What I learned

This project teached me how to create a Masonery layout, also help to get in touch with the new version of next js, next 14 and the app director, the practice of tailwind was also really nice

### Continued development

We can add some animation that activate if the user has movement active in his browser
